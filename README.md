# Clustering-Countries-for-Strategic-Aid-Allocation
This project uses clustering to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors affecting development. It helps HELP International, a humanitarian NGO, strategically allocate $10 million by identifying countries most in need of aid, ensuring effective use of resources for maximum impact.
